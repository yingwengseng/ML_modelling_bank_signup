# ML_modelling_bank_signup

## problem statement
You are a data analyst working for a Portuguese bank. The bank has recently run a campaign to attempt to sell a new product to customers over the phone. The product is a term deposit, where customers deposit their money for a fixed period of time for a fixed interest rate. They want to analyze the results of this campaign to understand what makes customers likely to buy this particular product. Your job as the data analyst is to explore the data and use machine learning to build a model to predict whether a customer is likely to buy.

logistic regression and KNN machine learning modelling is used in this project.

## conclusion
As for this business case, recall score is of higher priority as we can efficiently target deposit sign ups. 

Concluded that logistic regression is a better model as weight class is customisable and we are able to achieve higher recall which benefits the bank. More effort and time could be spent on the higher chance sign up customers and salesperson can commit more time to them which will improve sales efficiency. Less time will be spent on potential non-signups.
