You are a data analyst working for a Portuguese bank. The bank has recently run a campaign to attempt to sell a new product to customers over the phone. The product is a term deposit, where customers deposit their money for a fixed period of time for a fixed interest rate. They want to analyze the results of this campaign to understand what makes customers likely to buy this particular product. Your job as the data analyst is to explore the data and use machine learning to build a model to predict whether a customer is likely to buy.
